        <h1>Invisible risks——Communicate technology privacy and ethics</h1>
        <h2>When technology feels too smart?
</h2>
        <p>Do you know? Some of the things that people discussed were soon recommended to them on social media. When it comes to privacy issues, I have a real-life experience to share. A few days ago, I was chatting with my friends about a product from the platform, discussing it in a completely real-life context. But after that when I opened my social media account, the content we had just discussed suddenly appeared in the recommendations on my homepage! At that moment, I was completely confused. Was it a coincidence? Or were social platforms secretly “listening” to our conversations? Although technology companies usually deny listening in on conversations, this experience made me start to consider how safe my privacy is in the digital world seriously.
That incident made me unconsciously think of a post that I had seen on social media. There was once an AI chat software that was exposed for secretly leaking users’ private information. This made me shudder in my bones. Could it be that we have been constantly under the watchful gaze of invisible surveillance?

        <h2>Privacy concerns are not just a feeling
</h2> 
        <p>Concerns like this are not just personal feelings, they are supported by real cases investigated by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. According to the Canadian privacy authority, there have been many cases where technology companies collected, used, or shared user’s personal information without clear permission. In some cases, companies collected much more data than they actually needed, such as information about user’s interests, habits, and online behavior. The Privacy Commissioner had warned that when people do not clearly understand how their data is collected and used, their privacy can be at risk. These cases show that privacy problems are real, and they are being taken seriously by the government.

        <h2>If technology could talk
</h2>
        <p>If technology could talk, it would know more about us than we might expect. Apps would know what we like, where we go, what we search for, and what we click on every day. Even small actions, such as pausing on video or liking a post, can tell platforms a lot about our interests and habits. This is how communication technologies are able to create personalized content that feels almost too accurate.
However, technology itself is not good or bad. It is simply a tool created by humans. The real issue comes from how this technology is used. When companies collect too much data without clear permission, privacy can be violated. When users share content without thinking about others, ethical problems begin to appear. These issues are not caused by technology alone, but by the choices people and companies make.
This is why ethics matter in the digital world. Respecting privacy, being careful about what we share, and thinking about the impact of our actions are all human responsibilities. Technology may be powerful, but it is our decisions that shape whether it is used in a safe and ethical way.

        <h2>Can you tell the difference?
</h2>
        <p>Can you always tell the difference between what is real and what is created or influenced by technology? In today’s digital world, this question is becoming harder to answer. With the rise of AI tools, edited images, and personalized content, many things we see online are no longer as simple as they seem.
This confusion is not just something a few people notice. According to Statistics Canada (2023), 59% of Canadians are very or extremely concerned about misinformation online, and 43% say it has become harder to tell what is real and what is fake on the internet. This means almost half of people feel unsure about the content they see every day. When fake images, AI-generated videos, and misleading posts appear in our feeds, it becomes easy to misunderstand the truth without realizing it. These numbers show that the problem is not rare—it is something many people are already experiencing in their daily online lives.
For example, some images on social media may look completely real, but they are actually edited or generated by AI. Some videos may be taken out of context to change their meaning. Even comments and reviews can be written by robots instead of humans. Sometimes AI creates completely strange content, like a video of an orange cat cooking dinner or a dog singing pop songs, and people might believe it is real without proof. When these types of content are shared without clear labels, users may be wronged without realizing it.
This creates both privacy and ethical issues. From a privacy point of view, AI systems often need large amounts of data to work, and this data can come from real people’s photos,voices, or personal information. From an ethical point of view, sharing or believing false content can harm others, spread unreal information, and damage trust between people.

        <h2>Security risks we often ignore
</h2>
        <p>Privacy is not the only concern when using communication technologies, security issues are very serious. Many people reuse the same password on different platforms, making it easier for hackers to access multiple accounts at once. Fake emails and fake links can also trick users into giving away personal information without noticing. In addition, using public WIFI without protection can expose private data to attackers. These security risks show that even small online habits can cause serious consequences if users are not careful.
</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Next time you scroll through your feed, laugh at a funny AI video, or click on a recommended post, take a moment to notice. How much of what you’re seeing is really random, and how much has been quietly nudged just for you?
Imagine opening your phone tomorrow and seeing exactly what you were thinking about this morning before you even typed it. Is it a coincidence or something else? The line between what you choose and what is suggested to you is becoming harder to see. Every click, every like, every watch leaves a tiny touch quietly shaping what comes next.
And then you realize: even when you think you’re just scrolling for fun, the world inside your screen might already know the story before you do.
